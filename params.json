{"name":"Rift-timer","tagline":"A small application for tracking (regular) rift completion times in Diablo 3.","body":"# Rift Timer\r\n\r\nRift Timer is a small stopwatch-style application for manually tracking\r\nthe length of (regular) rifts in Diablo 3. I got the idea while trying to\r\npush faster and faster speed rifts while farming after getting tired of\r\nguessing based on looking at the clock when starting and stopping a rift.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to bother searching for a stopwatch program already out there\r\nbecause there's never a guarantee something small like that will do exactly\r\nwhat you want it to in the given context. I wanted a way to keep track of\r\nelapsed time and also log specific information related to what I was timing.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"images/example.png\"/></p>\r\n\r\nThe main feature, other than the stopwatch of course, is the logging of each\r\nfinished timer, along with information like the currently selected player\r\nclass and the currently selected difficulty. The list of completed rifts will\r\nbe logged to a timestamped file in the logs folder, found in the Rift Timer\r\nfolder wherever you put it after unzipping.\r\n\r\n# Themes and Modes\r\n\r\nAn alternative theme is available, accessed via the theme chooser in the\r\nsettings pane. The settings pane can be accessed by right clicking anywhere\r\ninside the program window.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"images/example3.png\"/></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"images/example5.png\"/></p>\r\n\r\nCompact mode can be activated via the right click menu as well (click or press 'c'\r\nwhile the menu is opened). Compact mode will shorten the height of the \r\nwindow, cutting off the log box and class/difficulty dropdown menus. The log\r\nbox will still update in compact mode, and rift times will still be saved \r\nand able to be viewed at any time by toggling off compact mode.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"images/example4.png\"/></p>\r\n\r\n# Hotkeys\r\n\r\nUsing the modifier Shift+Ctrl, there are 4 global hotkeys available to Rift Timer.\r\nS to start/resume, F to finish, E to pause, and R to reset.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
