# Rift Timer

Rift Timer is a small stopwatch-style application for manually tracking
the length of (regular) rifts in Diablo 3. I got the idea while trying to
push faster and faster speed rifts while farming after getting tired of
guessing based on looking at the clock when starting and stopping a rift.

I didn't want to bother searching for a stopwatch program already out there
because there's never a guarantee something small like that will do exactly
what you want it to in the given context. I wanted a way to keep track of
elapsed time and also log specific information related to what I was timing.

The main feature, other than the stopwatch of course, is the logging of each
finished timer, along with information like the currently selected player
class and the currently selected difficulty. I've been thinking about having
this logged information be saved to a log file when the session is ended but
for now that will be saved for the future.
